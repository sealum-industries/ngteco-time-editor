# NGTECO TIME EDITOR

This is a small web application to process the CSV files generated by the NGTeco Time app. NGTeco manufactures digital punch clocks (among other things). We wanted a way to edit and save this info in a database.

- [NGTECO Website](https://www.ngteco.com/)
- [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1485501591?mt=8)
- [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ngteco.ngtecotime)

## Development

Built with [Remix](https://remix.run/docs), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/).

From your terminal:

```sh
yarn dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

## Setup

Four environment variables are needed. These can be in a `.env` file for development, or set up in your hosting environment. See Remix docs for details.

```sh
SESSION_SECRET=some_random_string_of_text_for_browser_sessions
DATABASE_URL=prisma_database_url_see_Prisma_docs
APP_USER_NAME=name_for_the_app_user
APP_USER_PASSWORD=password_for_the_app_user
```

This repo defaults to using MS SQL Server for the database. If you need to use something else, you will also need to change the following code in `/prisma/prisma.schema`:

```javascript
datasource db {
  provider = "sqlserver"    // <- change this for other database providers
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

The app uses a single pre-defined user account (`APP_USER_NAME`, `APP_USER_PASSWORD`) which is created in the `/prisma/seed.ts` file.

Some Prisma commands used:

```sh
npx prisma db push
npx prisma generate

node --require esbuild-register prisma/seed.ts
```

Consult the [Prisma Docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs) for detailed instructions on hooking up a database.
